Functions and arrays first.


Arrays need to be backed by an appropriate data structure (or a flat array)
For variables


Need to implement:

IF seek to THEN or ELSE/EOL

Line numbers/programs, strings

FOR variables
GOSUB

Strings especially - null terminated is wasteful and prevents pointing
to program memory.
