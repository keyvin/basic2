Ideas 

Keep only two or three working variables alive per interpreter frame. Store results. 

Rules for parens

( - next to an immediate, *. next to an array variable, index.

return "," as an operator (it is)


a line can only start with a number if it will be a line-no. A numerical token or string should generate an error


if there is a line number, it must be added to the program

next symbol is either a reserved word or a variable assignment. Otherwise an error
   expr1                     expr2			   expr3 
if (read tokens until) then (read tokens until else) else (read tokens)
       expr1 
while (read tokens)

FOR (symbol) = VAL to VAL

NEXT

for variables re-encountered will be overwritten (restarted) in the current execution frame
a valid expression can be evaluated. ':" can deliminate several expressions.

assignment is an expression. gosub is an expression. functions are an expression. 


any expression that contains a string returns a string.
